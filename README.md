### Tic Tac Toe implementation in BASH
---
Maybe it is not so elegant, but I wanted to test my new skills learned from the book [TLCL](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php), which I still read. 
I strongly recommend this book for anyone who want to learn the basics of typical linux command line and shell scripting.

Maybe I'll cleanup the structure of the script if I learn something new from the book or elsewhere that could improve its structure.

Now I think my small project is completed. I also wanted to implement multiplayer, but I couldn't figure out how to make it. Writing big things or even small at times is quite annoying in BASH; the shell scripts are too hairy for me. In the near future I should definitely learn an actual programming language.  

After finishing TLCL in the past month, I still have the opinion that this book is good for a beginner to learn about GNU/Linux environments and will recommend it in the future.
