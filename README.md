### Tic Tac Toe implementation in BASH
---
It's maybe not so elegant, but I wanted to test my new skills learned from the book [TLCL](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) (I still read it). 
I strongly recomend the book for anyone who want to learn the basics of typical linux command line and shell scripting.

Maybe I'll cleanup the structure of the script if I learn something new from the book or elsewhere that could improve its structure.
